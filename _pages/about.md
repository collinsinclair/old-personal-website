## TLDR

I study astrophysics and computer science at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) where I work as a live presenter and educator at the [Fiske Planetarium](https://www.colorado.edu/fiske/) and as a [learning assistant](https://www.colorado.edu/program/learningassistant/). I have also recently accepted a _Student Assistant III: Scientific Data Visualization Designer_ position at [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) -- the National Center for Atmospheric Science. Finally, I have the pleasure of being the music director and pianist at [Front Range Theatre Company](http://www.frontrangetheatre.org/).

## Academics

### Astrophysics

#### Backstory

After playing keys[^1] in my first musical, Legally Blonde the Musical, during my freshman year of high school, I was certain that I wanted to make a career of playing shows on Broadway. I was well on my way too -- by the time I was in my senior year, I was playing at the professional level in community theaters, and I had auditioned for and was accepted by the Berklee College of Music for piano performance. Then I played a five-week run of Disney's The Little Mermaid at five shows a week. By my **25th** performance playing the _exact same thing_ (which is what the job is: to be a keyboard playing robot, not to be creative and come up with new stuff), I learned that the repetitive nature of playing shows on Broadway (which is typically eight shows a week, indefinitely) was not for me.

So with _just_ enough time left, I applied to the undergraduate astrophysics program at the University of Colorado at Boulder. This was kind of a whimsical decision -- I suddenly had to figure out what to do with my life after years of being certain about my career path! I chose CU Boulder because it was a large, public research institution not more than an hour away from home, and it came with a wicked backyard that I could hike and climb in.

As to what I would study: I was generally a successful student in high school, earning good grades and taking the "advanced" math and science classes. I have always been interested in space (an interest particularly fostered by hard sci-fi films like _Interstellar_ and _The Martian_), and I figured that a quantitative, technical degree like astrophysics would both prepare me for and be appealing to the workforce as an adult. Added bonus: I thought that being able to say "I have a degree in astrophysics" sounded really freaking cool.

I study astrophysics at CU Boulder -- a program that is jointly supervised by the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences and the Department of Physics. I have completed coursework in

- mathematics (multivariate calculus, linear algebra, differential equations),
- instrumentation, laboratory physics, and observational astronomy (including operation of a 24-inch Boller & Chivens f/8 Cassegrain and observing time at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico), and
- theoretical physics (classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, stellar/interstellar astrophysics, galactic/extragalactic astrophysics)


### Computer Science

#### Backstory

I came into college having never written a program (not even a "Hello, world!") and with no expectation of falling in love with the discipline.

Throughout my studies, I learned that my favorite part of all of my assignments and projects was the programming required to complete the work. This began with _Introduction to Scientific Programming_ in the fall of 2019, a lower-division course offered by the astronomy department to get students up to speed with Python and Jupyter notebooks for scientific applications (the course where I built the "alpha" version of my [N-Body Simulation](/project/n-body-simulation)). To this day, ASTR 2600 is one of my favorite courses.

In the next semester (spring 2020), I took a _Linear Algebra and Differential Equations_ computer lab through the applied mathematics department where I learned programming with Matlab, further cementing my fascination.[^2] That same semester, I took _Scientific Data Analysis and Computation_ through the astronomy department, the successor to _Intro to Scientific Programming_ with a greater emphasis on statistics and error analysis. I have to admit that I was quite sad at the thought of finishing this course -- it would mark what I thought was the end of my programming-specific coursework for my degree.

Then the pandemic hit. I remember in explicit detail where I was (walking home from campus, on Folsom St. crossing University Heights Ave.) when I got the email that CU was to finish the spring semester remotely. All of my shows/groups at Fiske had cancelled, and it felt like the world was going into hibernation. Soon thereafter, I got the call that the summer camp (Front Range Theatre) I had planned to work at between academic years was cancelled as well, leaving my summer wide open.

After finishing this bizarre and, dare I say, _unprecedented_ (I'm so sorry) semester, I was ready to spend my summer at home doing a lot of running and not much else. Literally _one day_ before the summer session of classes began, I spoke with a good friend and former roommate who convinced me to sign up for the CS 1 summer course, just to see what it was like. So I did.
