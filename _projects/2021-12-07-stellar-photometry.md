In this term project for a course on astronomical observation and instrumentation, my team observed the color index (which indicates stellar surface temperature) and apparent magnitude (which indicates absolute brightness of the stars) in two open clusters, M34 and M37. After calibrating the images and fluxes with known distance information, we used aperture photometry to generate so-called Color-Magnitude diagrams that show

- that most of the stars in the clustes are on the main sequence (the large diagonal shape on the left half of the plot â€” this is largley an indicator that our analysis is correct; most stars in the universe *are* on the main sequence),
- that M37 has further reaching horizontal branch and earlier main sequence turnoff, indicating that it is older than M34.

The images below show our observations of both clusters with sources identified, as well as individual color magnitude-diagrams for earch cluster.
