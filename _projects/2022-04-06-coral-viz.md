This [interactive map](https://ncar.github.io/coral-viz/map/index.html) was my first project working as a student assistant at NCAR â€” the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Our group, ViSR (Visualization Services and Research), works as a sort of consulting group: scientists come to us for visualizations and app development that supports their work.

In this case, researchers Scott Bachman and Joanie Kleypas simulated large datasets that portray daily temperature range, average temperature, and mixed layer depth all over the world. A collegue of mine produced the map tiles from the data, and my job was to make the map interactive and publicly availble.

The app is powered by Leaflet.js, styled with Bootstrap 5, and hosted on GitHub pages.
